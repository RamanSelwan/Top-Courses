### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node. js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): It comes with Node.js installation.

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. You can use the git clone command.
 
       git clone https://github.com/RamanSelwan/Top-Courses

2. Navigate to the Project Folder: Use the 'cd' command to move into the project directory:

        cd project-folder

3. Install Dependencies: If the project has any dependencies, you need to install them. For a typical React project, this involves running:

       npm install

4. Start the Project: Most React projects use 'npm' to start the development server. You can do this with the following command. This will launch the development server and open your project in a web browser.

       npm start

 5.  Access the Project: Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by the development server, which is typically http://localhost:3000. You should see your project running.
